* [**Data foldercontaining the data set you used**](https://github.com/TCG85/Labs-Projects/tree/master/Projects/module-2_projects/03_tableau-project/your-code/Data)


## Approach and code for constructing visualizations/story 

- Getting data (two different data sets) from Eurostat data base
- Looking at revenue generated by whole EU economy first, then narrow this down to revenue generated by e-commerce only
- Analyzing correlation between two data sets, creating scatter plot 
- Deep dive into importance of e-commerce depending on business size (# employees)
- Comparing sales through website vs. marketplace with regards to business size


## Results

- Some economical strong countries carry the majority of the sales generated within the EU
- Countries in center of EU are the economical strong countries
- Countries with smaller total economy (e.g. Nordics, BE, IR, CZ, HU) used e-commerce to grow their economy over last years
- Larger businesses tend to generate a larger proportion of  total revenue through e-commerce
- Importance of marketplaces as a sales channel increases with smaller business size
